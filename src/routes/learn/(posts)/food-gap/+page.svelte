  By 2050, the global population is projected to reach approximately 10 billion, with a dramatic
  shift towards urbanization [Source: UN Population Projections]. An estimated three billion more
  people will join the middle class during this time, bringing with it significant changes in
  consumption patterns [Source: Brookings Institution]. Historically, as individuals gain economic
  means, diets shift, incorporating more calories and a more significant proportion of
  resource-intensive foods like meat and dairy.

  This increased demand carries environmental consequences. Animal agriculture exerts significant
  pressure on land, water, and greenhouse gas emissions. Relying solely on scaling up production
  using current methods risks the clearing of vital ecosystems to support growing herds and feed
  crops. [Consider adding visual: Simple line graph showing population increase/projected
  middle-class growth compared to potential deforestation for livestock].

  Globally, diets are trending towards Western patterns heavily reliant on refined carbohydrates,
  sugars, fats, and animal-based products. Meanwhile, the consumption of healthier plant-based
  staples like pulses, vegetables, and whole grains is declining. This dietary convergence stems
  from a complex mix of factors including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Rising incomes</b>: Directly correlate with demand for animal-based proteins, vegetable oils,
    and processed foods.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Urbanization</b>: Concentrated populations have increased access to supermarkets,
    restaurants, and fast-food chains promoting these dietary choices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Globalized food systems</b>: Technology, multinational companies, and global trade networks
    heavily influence dietary choices of consumers on a massive scale.
  </li>
</ul>
