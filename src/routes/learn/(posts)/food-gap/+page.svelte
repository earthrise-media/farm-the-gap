  By 2050, the global population will reach 9.7 billion. Populations will continue to urbanize, and
  millions more people will join the middle class.<sup

  A <em>Nature</em> meta-analysis of 57 food projection studies found that between 2010 and 2050,
  global food demand was expected to increase by 30â€“62% with climate change taken into account.<sup

  <div class="figure-subtitle label">Why do we need to increase food production by 50%?</div>
  <ul class="text-sm">
    <li>
      <b>Rising population</b>: We need to feed an additional two billion people by 2050.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Rising incomes</b>: Income directly correlates with demand for animal-based proteins, oils,
      and processed foods.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Urbanization</b>: Concentrated populations have increased access to supermarkets,
      restaurants, and fast-food chains promoting resource-intensive dietary choices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Globalized food systems</b>: Technology, multinational companies, and global trade networks
      heavily influence dietary choices of consumers on a massive scale.
    </li>
  </ul>

  This increased demand carries environmental consequences. Inefficient agriculture exerts
  significant pressure on land, water, and greenhouse gas emissions. Relying solely on scaling up
  production using current methods risks deforestation, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and
  pollution, and climate change intensification.

  There are multiple strategies that can contribute to closing this food gap, which we explore in
