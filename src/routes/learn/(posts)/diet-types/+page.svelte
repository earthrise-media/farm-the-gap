  Choosing an earth-friendly diet takes some digging beyond marketing trends and dietary myths.
  Research consistently points to beef and other meats from grazing animals as the most
  resource-intensive foods. Land, water, and greenhouse gas emissions soar due to these industries,
  taking a serious toll on our environment.
</p>

<p>
  While veganism offers the lowest environmental impact, vegetarian and pescatarian diets are also
  powerful choices, slashing your footprint compared to meat-heavy eating habits. Even the
  flexitarian model, prioritizing plants while leaving room for occasional animal proteins, lessens
  the burden on our resources.
</p>

<p>
  Beef and other ruminant meats (sheep and goat) are by far the most resource-intensive of foods,
  requiring four to six times more land and generating that many times more greenhouse gas emissions
  than dairy per calorie or unit of protein ultimately consumed by people. Beef and other ruminants
  also require more than 20 times more land and generate more than 20 times more greenhouse gas
  emissions than pulses per unit of protein consumed. (like beans and lentils) per unit of protein.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, going vegan yourself has a similar impact to convincing four friends to
  significantly reduce their beef consumption. Additionally, capping protein intake for the entire
  population at 60g per day would have a greater environmental impact than a quarter of that
  population going fully vegetarian [1].

<p>
  The best diet for the planet isn't about perfection for a select few. It's about the consistent
  commitment to sustainable eating embraced by many. Smaller portions, plant-forward meals,
  sustainably-sourced ingredients – each informed choice creates a ripple effect. It's a powerful
  reminder that every decision on our plates holds the potential for positive change.

<p>A small change by many is more powerful than a great change made by few. Less can be more!</p>

<h3>A note on nutrients</h3>
<p>
  Plant-based diets easily supply important nutrients. Focus on iron-rich options like lentils,
  leafy greens, or fortified foods, and ensure adequate B12 intake. Seeking guidance from a
  registered dietitian is wise for those with specific dietary requirements or concerns.
</p>

<h3>Some dietary myths</h3>

<ul>
  <li>More protein is better. We actually only need 50g per day, (average person globally).</li>
  <li>
    Animal proteins are better than plant proteins. Plant proteins can be combined to get the full
    range of required amino acids and micronutrients (aside from Vit. B12)
  </li>
  <li>
    Plant proteins need to be combined every meal. The body stores amino acids separately and uses
    as required, so the complete set of AA’s not required in every meal sitting
  </li>
</ul>
